Non Linear DS (Hierachiacl )

Hierarchical data structures are structures where data is organized in a tree-like format, with elements having parent-child
 relationships. These are used when you need to represent
 data that has a nested or ranked structure, such as organizational charts, file systems, XML/HTML documents, etc.
