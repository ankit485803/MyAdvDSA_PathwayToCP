/* Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.


Key Properties
Base Case: The condition that stops recursion (prevents infinite loops).
Recursive Case: The part where the function calls itself with a smaller subproblem.

How It Works? (Recursive Tree) 

TC = O(n)--Each call reduces n by 1
SC = O(n)  -- Due to the recursive call stack.


Application = factorial, fibonaci series, 

Optimized Fibonacci (Using Memoization)
