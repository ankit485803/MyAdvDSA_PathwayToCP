What is LeetHub?

LeetHub is a platform that integrates LeetCode with GitHub, enabling users to easily upload their LeetCode solutions to a 
GitHub repository. It automatically syncs your LeetCode submissions and commits them to your GitHub repo. In addition to 
syncing your code, it often tracks performance metrics like execution time and memory usage.


How to Use LeetHub: Step-by-Step
Step 1: Install LeetHub
        First, you need to install LeetHub on your machine. This can be done using the LeetHub Chrome Extension.
        Go to the Chrome Web Store and search for LeetHub or click here
        Add the extension to Chrome.
        Once installed, you’ll see the LeetHub extension icon in the top-right corner of your browser.




Step 2: Authenticate LeetHub with GitHub and LeetCode

Step 3: Sync LeetCode Solutions to GitHub
    Once you have set up everything, whenever you solve a problem on LeetCode, LeetHub will give you the option to upload your solution directly to your GitHub repository.
    Solve a problem on LeetCode.
    After submitting your solution on LeetCode, click the LeetHub icon.
    Select the "Sync" option to commit your solution to your GitHub repository.
    Your solution will now appear in your GitHub repository under the correct problem directory, along with the performance metrics (time and space usage).        



Step 4: Access Your Solutions on GitHub
Step 5: Track Performance
LeetHub provides time and space metrics for each solution. This is where you can track how efficient your solution is:

    Time: Measures how fast your code runs. Lower times are better, as they indicate a faster solution.
    Space: Measures how much memory your code uses. Lower space usage is better, especially when you’re working with limited resources.
    These metrics can help you optimize your solutions. If you notice your code is using too much time or space, you can try to optimize it by:
                Reducing time complexity: Try to find a more efficient algorithm.
                Reducing space complexity: Use more memory-efficient data structures.    







LeetHub Features Summary
        Automatic Syncing: Syncs your LeetCode solutions with GitHub automatically.
        Performance Metrics: Tracks execution time and memory usage.
        GitHub Integration: Keeps your solutions organized on GitHub for easy access.
        Portfolio: Having a public repository of LeetCode problems can showcase your coding abilities to potential employers.
