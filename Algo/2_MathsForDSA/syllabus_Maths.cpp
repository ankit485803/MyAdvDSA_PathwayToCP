8. Fast & Power exponentiation

Fast exponentiation (also known as Exponentiation by Squaring) is a method used to efficiently compute powers of a number. It drastically reduces the number of multiplications needed to compute powers, especially when 
dealing with large exponents.

The idea behind fast exponentiation is based on the binary decomposition of the exponent. Instead of performing multiple 
multiplications, we break the problem down into smaller powers, which allows us to compute the result in logarithmic time.

A Catalan number is a sequence of natural numbers that appear in various counting problems in combinatorial mathematics. Catalan numbers count the number of ways certain combinatorial objects 
can be arranged, such as binary trees, valid parentheses sequences, and many other combinatorial structures.
